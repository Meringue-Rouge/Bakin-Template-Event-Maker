# What's working:
- Parsing default templates (not fully complete)
- Exporting with changes
- Importing custom events (partial) without a template, generating templates based on comments in the event

# Tested
- Item variable

# Usage:
- Create an event in Bakin.
- To define the variables / lines of the event that should be changeable through parameters, create a comment event just above the line that needs to be shown, in the format of #keyword, with keyword being a keyword of your choice.
  - **If a single parameter is used multiple times throughout the event**, place another comment over each line that should use a unique field in the template with the same keyword.
  - For different parameters, use a different keyword.
- Export the event into a txt file.
- Upload it to the website.
- Configure information on the fields, the site should detect thanks to the comments the fields and type of fields for the parameter.
- If you need a default GUID (for graphics), go to Bakin, into the Resources, then 3D or 2D Stamps, and right-click the stamp you want and copy the GUID.
- When all your fields are correct, register a file id from 090000 upwards. You can't have two files with the same file id in your engine.
- Give it a file name.
- Export and open your Bakin's Steamapps folder, located where your steam install is at.
  - Go to Steam\steamapps\common\BAKIN\data\en if you use an English version of Bakin, or Steam\steamapps\common\BAKIN\data\jp for a Japanese version.
  - For common events, drop it in the common_templates folder.
  - For a map event, drop it in the templates folder.
- Make sure to add a bmp file with the exact same name as your txt file. Make a duplicate of one of the defaults in the same folder and rename it if you don't have one.
- Close Bakin entirely and then open a game project.
- For common events, it'll appear at the bottom when creating a standard common event. For a map event, it'll show up in a Event folder in the Events tab of placable entities.
